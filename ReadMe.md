# ReviewNinja-Welcome

**Thanks for letting us show you around!**

What youâ€™re seeing here is a GitHub pull request with the code diffs
showing by default. Feel free to look around.

Over on the right is a panel for line notes that you can connect to a
line of code in the diff. You can also switch to the conversation
to see comments on the whole pull request.

---Does this end end up fixing the thing I want?----


Line notes have flags to indicate what is going on in the code,
too. Flags are as follows:

`['!fix', '!resolve']`
- Something in the code needs to be reviewed and fixed before
  the pull request is merged.

`['!fixed', '!resolved', '!completed']`
- The issue has been resolved.
